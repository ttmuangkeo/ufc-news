<p>Setting up a watch and doing an API call for a list of breeds, so our dropdown is populated with the relevant animal breeds. Success!</p>

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
<p>Occasionally user profiles will become unretrievable. We have debugged a few causes (mostly related to Auth tokens), but a few cases still have issues and we have not been able to reliably reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>In Progress: Issues getting animations to work with angular insted of jQuery. Looking forward to taking those on at a later date for version 2.0</p>
